            <p>The emphasis in this branch of human-computer interaction is on communication through technology.
            Social computing involves emailing, social media, and other similar online activities.<br/>
            There are several beneficial aspects offered by this field. Methods of social computing are used<br/> 
            by online retailers, such as bids, reviews, and so on, to their benefit.
            This area is significant since data, reviews, articles, and more can be created quickly.
            Quality can be enhanced through open source, like articles or code.
            For consumers, social computing can provide reliabilty or real opinions through reviews of products.
            Online social activities can be used to accomplish more than an indivdual and computer could do.</p>
